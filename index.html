    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
      <p>Iâ€™m a recent graduate with a bachelor in Information Technology.</p>
      <p>I have interest in System Administration and Databases in IT. I am skilled at Database planning and scripting and find this very satisfying when done correctly. I am always willing to learn more and increase my knowledge and skills as much as possible and aspire to one-day work within an industry that I can excel in and where I will be able to offer a diverse set of skills.</p>
      <p>While studying I work on a project to develop and CRM, this included working closely with the client.</p>
      <p>People who have taking me on as an employee have not regretted it, I've brought great ideas to the table and carried out task correctly and in time.</p>
